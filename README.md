# DL-mentorship-2022
Notebook files originally written in Google Colab.
These files were created while studying up on computer vision and NLP under a mentor from NVIDIA Hong Kong, in Apr-Jun 2022.
This repository contains the files that are shareable. Not all files are included. A literature review I wrote is not included in this repository.

In cifar_10_resnets_reimplementation.ipynb I reimplement some ResNet networks from He et al. 2015, from scratch.
In fashion_products_classifier.ipynb I create an image classifier using Kaggle datasets.
In Transformer_reimplementation.ipynb I reimplement the famous Transformer architecture from Vaswani et al. 2017.
